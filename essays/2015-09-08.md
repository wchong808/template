## Have you asked yourself this yet?

It is important for engineers to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economical, environmental and societal context so they can contribute to the society positively. The global context is becoming increasingly important because the economy is globalized and engineering solutions can have a worldwide impact. It is also important for engineers to keep up with the latest technologies, current politics, and societal issues to familiarize themselves with what is going on around them . Engineers must be awaye that their solutions can have an impact on people’s lives in both positive and negative ways. 

## So why?

The global context of engineering solutions is becoming increasingly important because the economy is globalized and the solutions of engineers can have a worldwide impact. It is also important for engineers to keep up with the latest technologies, and the current politics and social issues because if they don’t they can have a negative impact on society as a whole. Being less educated of current news can cause engineers to create solutions that might either be not up to current standards or materials which can also be harmful to the environment.  

Computer Engineering and IT go hand in hand in today’s society and it has brought together some of greatest technology we see today. 10 years ago, high-speed internet or wireless data, and was very expensive as demand for it was high and supply for it was low. But today, high-speed internet is affordable and is a main part of our lives.

Other than the internet that has been created along with wifi, computer processors have largely been improved since 10 years ago. This created a big influence on the global economy as well because of how much faster computers can now solve simple problems and how it brings ideas to life. With faster processors, we are not only working faster but we are working more efficiently. 
Another major impact of computer engineering solutions we can see is in the medical field. We have seen the great impacts of MRIs and CT scan machines being made and what images and findings they can produce. Without the major developments in the engineering that goes into these machines, doctors would have failed to see a lot of the problems that go on in the human body and produce a correct prognosis for the patient to undergo treatment of any sort.


## And the other people?

One of the biggest ways that computer technology impacts societies and cultures in multiple countries are being able to use computer and phones. We now have access to almost everything. At the touch of our hands or the stroke of a key, we can see the whole world, we can go to different places, we can travel virtually to anywhere we want. This has impacted many people in society as it has brought new ideas to life, brought different cultures together, even different people together. With our computers and phones, we can look up information we need within minutes. It has made daily lives easier. 

Another way is connecting people in different cities, states, and countries from all around the world through conference calls, facetime, and video chatting. Engineering has brought this to life as it is now possible to see your relative in Venezuela even when you live in the Washington with a short video call away. It has not only impacted the consumer-based lives but many companies do conference and video calls to their employees as not everyone can make it to one place and one time. CEOs of big companies can have a meeting with a client in London and still be able to sit in on a meeting with their staff members back home in California.  

## Conclusion
From artificial intelligence to cyber bullying, both positive and negative impacts of  technology can be seen around the word.There are many issues out there, but with the greater technology, it has caused a lot of good as well. So many good things have come out of the research as well as things that the internet can provide us. There are always pros and cons to everything, and it depends on how someone uses it and how someone thinks and relate to the world what they want is how things become good and bad.
