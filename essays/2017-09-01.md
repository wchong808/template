## First Time on the Job
From my experience with C and Python, JavaScript is a sort of in between the two of those. JavaScript has some C syntax as well as Python syntax which makes it a lot easier than C and a good language to learn and get familiar with. In my option JavaScript is a very good language to learn in applying it to softwawre engineering. It is a good level to understand, not too low like C where a lot of things are need to be defined and written yourself which is good for a lot of hardware tinkling but it not as high as Python where it is very very simple to write. JavaScript is a good position for when we want to develop a webpage as well as other software related programs like games. 

## Stress Testing
Athletic software engineering is a new concept to me and is a very interesting concept to understand. I understand the concept in theory and see how a lot of people can benefit from it but donâ€™t know if it is the right type of learning style for me. Practice work out of programs and problems are very essential to this type of engineering environment. The practice WODs were very useful as they got me more familiar with what type of problems there will be and how they can be written and now I understand even more where I will need to put more time into studying and practicing. In retrospect though, this style of learning is a bit different and difficult for me. Being under time pressure is one of my weaknesses and something I definitely need to work on. Having a time limit not only stresses me out but it also makes me feel compelled to use other ways to understand and think about the problem like going to google as my first instinct. But I hope as time goes on, I will be able to be comfortable with this style of learning and be able to ace all things under time pressure.
