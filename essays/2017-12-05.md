This sounds like a mouth full and might not make too much sense but let me expand and give you an analogy on it. Design patterns is like templates that you can apply to certain codes that you have written or that have been written. With this it is easier to rewrite code over and over again because it follows a specific way of things.

## Because I can, and because I will
There are many applications of software design when you make a web app. Things build upon each other and it's actually quite dumb to start from scratch. There is no reason and a waste of time, and as someone of the 21st century I don't really like wasting time. So we go back to design patterns. It's a reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem.
