summary: An interactive web application for Meraki Switch Configurations.
---

<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/MerakiSwitches.png">

Meraki Bulk Configuration is a web application that I helped create as a team project at World Wide Technology as a intern in Summer 2017. The project helped me learn how to design incorperate Python scripting into a web application.

Vacay is implemented using [Flask] (http://flask.pocoo.org/), a microframework for Python. Within three weeks, we created a website that implements configuration of multiple switches with one click .

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including the Flask Framework for the user interface and linking pages within HTML and Python, and Python for both client and server-side programming.
